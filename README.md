# Analysis pipelines for allele specific expression (ASE) in pigs

## 1. Introduction

The utitlities for unbiased allele-specific read mapping, discovery of Parent-of-origin effect (POE) genes and Allele-genotype effect (AGE) genes and exploring the characteristics of allelic patterns in chromatin accessibility and methylation.


## 2. Analysis pipelines

This repository contains analysis pipelines for ASE in pigs, including:

- Whole-genome sequence alignment, quality control, variants calling, and individualized genome reference construction
- RNA-seq alignment, quality control, quantification, variants calling, and transcriptome annotations
- Tissue-specific gene expression and stage-specific gene expression
- POE genes and AGE genes identification
- ATAC-Seq alignment, quality control, peaks calling, and genome-wide accessiable chromoatin signal visualization
- Peaks annotation, tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific chromatin accessibility analysis
- Allele-specific chromatin accessibility analysis
- WGBS alignment, quality control, duplication removing, methylation context extracting and CpG methylation matrix generation
- Allele-specific methylation analysis

Pipeline components are public available in this repository.
